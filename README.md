First iOS app using the Multi-Peer connectivity framework to access Wikipedia webpages on your phone without an internet or cellular connection (i.e. in Airplane mode) from others around you who do have a connection.

Ugly code, thrown together in under a day as a mere proof of concept. 

However, won first place for "Best Hack Potential" at Stony Brook's Unhackaton.

Created alongside two team members.

Precursor to an iOS app named 'WaveDoc' that is currently in the works.
