First iOS app using the Multi-Peer connectivity framework to access Wikipedia webpages on your phone without an internet or cellular connection (i.e. in Airplane mode) from others around you who do have a connection.

Ugly code, thrown together in under a day as a mere proof of concept. 

However, won first place for "Best Hack Potential" at Stony Brook's Unhackaton.

Precursor to an iOS app 'Hexlist' Yvan Scher and I are building.
